# TOP-library
TOP project - LIBRARY


## What Went Well: 
* looks nice
* i got to explore classes and objects which i hadn't done a lot of before
* first time making a modal
* further practice on DOM manipulation

## Improvements:
* gotta start using bootstrap, will make my life easier (no more styling buttons for ages)
* code could be cleaner/drier
* integrate firebase
* add an 'in progress' step to status button

I had a some difficulty figuring out how to remove cards/books but some googling later, I figured it out :)
Also, this was the first time I'd used local storage and I was really stuck on getting the change of status to save, after a lot of trying I took a peek at some other code and found a solution, feels like cheating but at least I learnt something from it - hopefully next time I'll be able to figure it out on my own. (UPDATE: I've implemented local storage on this new spellings game I'm working on, and I read through all the docs and actually figured it out myself :) so atleast we got there eventually LOL)
