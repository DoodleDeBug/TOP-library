# TOP-library
TOP project - LIBRARY


## What Went Well: 
* looks nice
* i got to explore classes and objects which i hadn't done a lot of before
* further practice on DOM manipulation

## Improvements:
* gotta start using bootstrap, will make my life easier (no more styling buttons for ages)
* code could be cleaner/drier

I had some difficulty figuring out how to remove cards/books but some googling later, I figured it out :)
Also, this was the first time I'd used local storage so that was fun, still not *100%* on it but hoping to improve as I go :)
